Looker Label Viewer allows you to see localized labels in lookml files without having to open the localization file.

## Features

Hover over a localized label to view the corresponding label value.

It currently does not support the ability to change extension settings related to:
- target localization file. It defaults to `en.strings.json`)
- Target attributes. It defaults to trying to get labels for:
  - label
  - group_label
  - group_item_label
  - view_label
